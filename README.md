# Number-crossing
A small game I made with python. It doesn't have UX/UI cuz i haven't learned tKinter...
The game initally was a single file but then i split it into multiple files in order to fix easier.

**WARNING:** Please run the game.py in python IDLE (version 3.10 or above). Otherwise, the game won't work.
